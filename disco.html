          <h3>Here's a list of reasons why Disco is so adorably derpy:</h3>
          <ul>
          	<li>His idea of hunting is to scream at animal until it comes to him.</li>
          	<li>He refuses to use his paws to get things do when his face will do.</li>
          	<li>He defies gravity by napping upside down.</li>
          	<li>There is nothing he won't stick his face in.</li>
          	<li>He is the only one on Earth who doesn't know he can't sing.</li>
          	<li>Glass doors are his mortal enemy.</li>
          	<li>He must test the integrity and edibility of every new object that enters my home.</li>
          	<li>He considers his butt his most formidable weapon.</li>
